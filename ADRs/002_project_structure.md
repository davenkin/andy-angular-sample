# Project structure

## Context

A consistent project structure makes the whole application easy to understand.

## Decision

We try to make the project structure as flat as possible while at the same time ensure all folders are in an organised
manner.

## Implementation

At the top level, there are 4 folders:

- `common`: contains everything that are common to the whole application, such as common APIs, shared components and
  global CSS styles.
- `console`: the entry folder for all console pages
- `environments`: contains configuration files for various environments
- `public`: contains all publicly accessed pages

Below is the detailed explanation of project structure:
- `common`: contains commonly used files across the whole application
  - `api`: common APIs 
  - `component`: shared Angular components
  - `config`: application level configuration files, such as authentication, error, i18n and routing
  - `directive`: shared Angular directives
  - `layout`: contains components for page layout structure
  - `model`: common models
  - `root`: the Angular root component
  - `service`: common services used across the whole application, such as confirmation, dialog and spinner etc.
  - `style`: global styles
  - `utils`: common utils
- `console`: contains all console pages, its first level subfolders should be based on domain/business, such as `device` and `member`
- `environments`: environments configuration files
- `public`: contains all publicly accessed pages, its first level subfolders should be based on domain/business, such as `home-page` and `pricing-page`
